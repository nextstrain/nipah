# Ingest

### With `nextstrain run`

If you haven't set up the nipah pathogen, then set it up with:

```bash
nextstrain setup nipah
```

Otherwise, make sure you have the latest set up with:

```bash
nextstrain update nipah
```	```

Run the ingest workflow with:

```bash
nextstrain run nipah ingest <analysis-directory>
```

Your `<analysis-directory>` will contain the workflow's intermediate files
and two final outputs:

- `results/metadata.tsv`
- `results/sequences.fasta`

#### Dumping the full raw metadata from NCBI Datasets

The workflow has a target for dumping the full raw metadata from NCBI Datasets.

```bash
nextstrain run nipah ingest <analysis-directory> dump_ncbi_dataset_report
```

This will produce the file `<analysis-directory>/data/ncbi_dataset_report_raw.tsv`, which you can inspect to determine what fields and data to use if you want to configure the workflow.

### With `nextstrain build`

If you don't have a local copy of the nipah repository, use Git to download it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextstrain/nipah.git
```

Otherwise, update your local copy of the workflow with:

```bash
cd nipah
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

Run the ingest workflow with

```bash
cd ingest
nextstrain build .
```

The `ingest` directory will contain the workflow's intermediate files and two final outputs:

- `results/metadata.tsv`
- `results/sequences.fasta`

#### Dumping the full raw metadata from NCBI Datasets

The workflow has a target for dumping the full raw metadata from NCBI Datasets.

```bash
nextstrain build ingest dump_ncbi_dataset_report
```

This will produce the file `ingest/data/ncbi_dataset_report_raw.tsv`,
which you can inspect to determine what fields and data to use if you want to
configure the workflow for your pathogen.

## Defaults

The defaults directory contains all of the default configurations for the ingest workflow.

[defaults/config.yaml](defaults/config.yaml) contains all of the default configuration parameters
used for the ingest workflow. Use Snakemake's `--configfile`/`--config`
options to override these default values.

## Snakefile and rules

The rules directory contains separate Snakefiles (`*.smk`) as modules of the core ingest workflow.
The modules of the workflow are in separate files to keep the main ingest [Snakefile](Snakefile) succinct and organized.

The `workdir` is hardcoded to be the ingest directory so all filepaths for
inputs/outputs should be relative to the ingest directory.

Modules are all [included](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html#includes)
in the main Snakefile in the order that they are expected to run.

## Build configs

The build-configs directory contains custom configs and rules that override and/or
extend the default workflow.

- [nextstrain-automation](build-configs/nextstrain-automation/) - automated internal Nextstrain builds.


### Nextstrain automated workflow

The Nextstrain automated workflow uploads results to AWS S3 with

```bash
nextstrain build \
    --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
    --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
    . \
        upload_all \
        --configfile build-configs/nextstrain-automation/config.yaml
```

## Input data

### GenBank data

GenBank sequences and metadata are fetched via [NCBI datasets](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/download-and-install/).
