We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for sharing their work. Please note that although data generators have generously shared data in an open fashion, that does not mean there should be free license to publish on this data. Data generators should be cited where possible and collaborations should be sought in some circumstances. Please try to avoid scooping someone else's work. Reach out if uncertain.

**We maintain four views of nipah evolution:**

1. [`nipah/all`](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/all), which focuses on the broader viral diversity of all nipah sequences submitted to GenBank that have a sequence length of at least 17000 nt. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence [NC_002728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728).
2. [`nipah/human`](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/human), which focuses on samples where host is annotated as "Homo sapiens" and that have a sequence length of at least 17000 nt. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence [NC_002728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728).
3. [`nipah/I`](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/I), which excludes samples annotated as from Malaysia, USA, Cambodia or is missing the country annotation all together. Samples must have a sequence length of at least 17000 nt. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence [NC_002728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728).
4. [`nipah/II`](https://nextstrain.org/nipah/II), which excludes samples annotated as from India, Bangladesh, or Thailand. Samples must have a sequence length of at least 17000 nt. Sequences are aligned to the reference sequence [NC_002728](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_002728).

#### Underlying data

We curate sequence data and metadata from NCBI as starting point for our analyses. Curated sequences and metadata are available as flat files at:

* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/nipah/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/nipah/sequences.fasta.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/nipah/metadata.tsv.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/nipah/metadata.tsv.zst)
