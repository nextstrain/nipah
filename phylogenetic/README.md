# Phylogenetic

This workflow uses metadata and sequences to produce one or multiple [Nextstrain datasets][]
that can be visualized in Auspice.

Resulting tree is available here: https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/staging/nipah

## Background

See e.g. [Whitmer et. al, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/7/1/veaa062/5894561)

## Usage

If you're unfamiliar with Nextstrain builds, you may want to follow our
[Running a Pathogen Workflow guide][] first and then come back here.

### With `nextstrain run`

If you haven't set up the nipah pathogen, then set it up with:

```bash
nextstrain setup nipah
```

Otherwise, make sure you have the latest set up with:

```bash
nextstrain update nipah
```

Run the phylogenetic workflow with:

```bash
nextstrain run nipah phylogenetic <analysis-directory>
```

Your `<analysis-directory>` will contain the workflow's intermediate files
and the final output `auspice/nipah_{build}.json` files.

You can view the result with

```bash
nextstrain view <analysis-directory>
```

### With `nextstrain build`

If you don't have a local copy of the nipah repository, use Git to download it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nextstrain/nipah.git
```

Otherwise, update your local copy of the workflow with:

```bash
cd mumps
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

Run the phylogenetic workflow workflow with

```bash
cd phylogenetic
nextstrain build .
```

The `phylogenetic` directory will contain the workflow's intermediate files
and the final output `auspice/nipah_{build}.json` files .

Once you've run the build, you can view the results with:

```bash
nextstrain view .
```

## Data Requirements

The core phylogenetic workflow will use metadata values as-is, so please do any
desired data formatting and curations as part of the [ingest](../ingest/) workflow.

1. The metadata must include an ID column that can be used as as exact match for
   the sequence ID present in the FASTA headers.
2. The `date` column in the metadata must be in ISO 8601 date format (i.e. YYYY-MM-DD).
3. Ambiguous dates should be masked with `XX` (e.g. 2023-01-XX).

## Defaults

The defaults directory contains all of the default configurations for the phylogenetic workflow.

[defaults/config.yaml](defaults/config.yaml) contains all of the default configuration parameters
used for the phylogenetic workflow. Use Snakemake's `--configfile`/`--config`
options to override these default values.

## Snakefile and rules

The rules directory contains separate Snakefiles (`*.smk`) as modules of the core phylogenetic workflow.
The modules of the workflow are in separate files to keep the main phylogenetic [Snakefile](Snakefile) succinct and organized.

The `workdir` is hardcoded to be the phylogenetic directory so all filepaths for
inputs/outputs should be relative to the phylogenetic directory.

Modules are all [included](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html#includes)
in the main Snakefile in the order that they are expected to run.
